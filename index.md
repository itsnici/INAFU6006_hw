# My Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my project website. This site contains three data analysis projects I completed during the course. Each project demonstrates different data analysis techniques and insights.

## Project List

### Project 1: Online Retail Data Analysis
Explored an online retail dataset containing 541,909 transaction records, analyzing product price distributions and transaction patterns. Using various statistical methods (including pandas and standard libraries), calculated and compared product price means, medians, and modes.

### Project 2: Student Performance Analysis
Analyzed a student performance dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, investigating:
- Correlation between Mathematics and Portuguese language grades
- Impact of study time on academic performance
The analysis revealed a positive correlation between study time and academic achievement.

### Project 3: California House Price Analysis
Using the California House Price dataset from Kaggle, studied:
- Price differences between coastal and inland areas
- Relationship between income levels and house prices
Through geographic visualization and statistical analysis, demonstrated how location and economic factors influence house prices.

## Tech Stack
In these projects, I utilized the following technologies:
- Python Data Analysis Libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization Tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Statistical Analysis Methods
- Geographic Data Processing (Geopandas)
